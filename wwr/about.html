        <section class="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Canyon Rapids Rafting was started in 1987 by two brothers in Arizona. They developed a love for white water rafting from their father whose favorite thing to do was take them on camping trips to the Colorado River and spend as much time on the river as possible. As the brothers grew up they continued the tradition with their own sons and eventually set up what is now Canyon Rapids Rafting. They love sharing the beauty of the Colorado River, and the thrill of racing down white rapids with all who come to visit. Their hope is to one day pass this tradition onto their own sons, and their sons after that.  </p>
