      <p>Hello! My name is Joshua Durrant, but most people call me Josh. Honestly people only call me Joshua If I am in trouble. I love my family! I am happily married and my wife and I have 5 kids. Everyday is adventure, but we love every second of it! If you can't tell by my picture one of my favorite activites is fishing. This picture is from a trip I took to South East Alaska. We fished for Silver Salmon. I have been fishing all over Utah and Arizona, and also back east in New York. Idaho is up next on my fishing trip list. I love to explore the beautiful earth our Heavenly Father Created for us. This programming stuff is new to me, but I am very excited to face a new challenge.</p>

      <p>Arizona is in the southwest part of the United States. It is considered a desert state with a dry climate, which is very true; but it also has one of the largest ponderosa pine forests in the country just 3 hours north of Phoenix. The diversity of landscape offers lots of opportunity for all outdoor recreation and exploration.
